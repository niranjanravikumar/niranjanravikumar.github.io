                    <p>“If you think the internet has changed your life, think again. The internet of things has changed

                </blockquote>
                <p>This quote perfectly captures my experience in EE701 - Internet of Things, a course that exceeded all
                    my expectations. When I enrolled in the class, I expected to learn about the technical underpinnings
                    of IoT systems, protocols, and applications. While the course certainly delivered on that front, it
                    also did much more—it redefined how I approach learning, problem-solving, and innovation.</p>
                <p>Unlike many traditional courses, Dr. Zhangyu Guan’s approach to teaching this subject was
                    refreshingly different. His pedagogy emphasized continuous, hands-on learning through practical
                    assignments and in-depth discussions, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the subject matter from
                    day one. This approach not only encouraged me to think critically about IoT technologies but also
                    pushed me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems, preparing me for both academic and
                    professional challenges.</p>
                <p>A particularly exciting part of the course was the capstone project, where I designed and developed
                    an IoT-based Motorcycle Helmet. This project allowed me to integrate various sensors, communication
                    protocols, and control systems to enhance motorcycle safety, providing real-time accident detection
                    and SOS alert functionalities. Working on this project was not only an application of the skills
                    learned in class but also an opportunity to create something impactful that could have real-world
                    benefits.</p>
                <p>Another highlight of the course was the guided laboratory sessions. In these labs, we gained hands-on
                    experience with different modules and sensors, such as accelerometers, temperature sensors, and
                    communication protocols like SPI and I2C. These sessions were structured to give us a practical
                    understanding of how IoT devices interact with the environment and communicate data, further
                    bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and its application.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the paper reading assignments, where we were required to read technical papers and
                    present our insights to the class, served a dual purpose. Not only did they keep us up to date with
                    the latest advancements in IoT, but they also significantly enhanced our presentation and
                    communication skills. These presentations challenged us to break down dense, complex research and
                    deliver it in a clear, accessible manner. This process helped refine our ability to convey technical
                    content effectively, a vital skill for any engineer.</p>
                <p>Dr. Guan’s teaching method fostered a deep understanding of how IoT systems work in a connected
                    world. Whether we were discussing the intricacies of network protocols like MQTT and NOMA, working
                    on projects like my IoT-based helmet, or experimenting with sensors in the laboratory sessions,
                    every aspect of the course was tied back to practical applications. This hands-on experience was
                    incredibly valuable, as it bridged the gap between theory and practice, ensuring I was not just
                    learning for the sake of passing exams but for developing skills that I could carry forward into my
                    career.</p>
                <p>The course structure gave me the freedom to explore areas of personal interest within IoT while still
                    gaining the foundational knowledge needed to excel in the field. In many ways, this experience
                    mirrored the real world, where there are often no clear-cut solutions, and success depends on one’s
                    ability to adapt and innovate. This course taught me not only how to build and optimize IoT systems
                    but also how to think like an engineer—constantly analyzing, refining, and improving.</p>
                <p>Dr. Guan’s course has been instrumental in shaping my outlook. The practical experience and in-depth
                    knowledge I gained, combined with opportunities to enhance my presentation skills and work on a
                    real-world capstone project, have made me more confident in tackling complex problems and designing
                    solutions that leverage IoT technology. This course didn’t just meet my expectations; it surpassed
                    them, leaving me better prepared for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the
                    ever-evolving field of IoT.</p>
