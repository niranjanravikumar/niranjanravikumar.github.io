                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The purpose of teaching is to inspire the desire for learning in them and make them able to
                        think, understand, and question.” – Richard P. Feynman</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Industrial Control Systems had always been a topic I was wary of, stemming from my undergraduate
                    experience where I struggled to grasp the subject. However, EE519, taught by Dr. Luis Herrera,
                    transformed my perspective and made it one of the most enriching courses of my academic journey.</p>
                <p>Dr. Herrera's teaching style was instrumental in making the course engaging and approachable. His
                    frequent quizzes encouraged consistent learning and helped solidify key concepts as we progressed.
                    The practical focus of the course further deepened my understanding of control systems, as we worked
                    on real-world applications of PI and PID controllers using MATLAB and Simulink.</p>
                <p>One of the most memorable aspects of the course was the homework assignments. They were thoughtfully
                    designed to challenge our analytical and creative abilities. Each assignment required us to apply
                    theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems, reinforcing my understanding of control systems
                    and their implementation.</p>
                <p>My favorite project involved designing a control system for an industrial process using MATLAB. This
                    project required us to model the system dynamics, design controllers, and simulate the system's
                    response to various inputs and disturbances. The hands-on nature of this project allowed me to apply
                    the concepts I had learned in a tangible way, bridging the gap between theory and practice.</p>
                <p>Beyond the technical skills, the course also helped me overcome my apprehensions and develop
                    confidence in my abilities. The frequent assessments ensured I was always on top of the material,
                    and Dr. Herrera's approachable demeanor made it easy to seek clarification when needed.</p>
                <p>EE519 was more than just a course for me; it was a testament to the power of resilience and a
                    reminder that with the right guidance and effort, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome.
                    The knowledge and skills I gained have not only prepared me for future endeavors in control systems
                    but have also instilled a newfound appreciation for the subject.</p>
