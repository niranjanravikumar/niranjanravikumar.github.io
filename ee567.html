                <p>EE567 - Power Electronics was one of the most challenging yet rewarding courses I have ever taken.
                    Taught by Dr. Xiu Yao, this course pushed me to my intellectual limits, teaching me the importance
                    of resilience and persistence in the face of adversity.</p>
                <p>At the start of the semester, I struggled with the rigorous assignments and advanced topics,
                    triggering feelings of imposter syndrome. However, Dr. Yao’s patient guidance and supportive
                    teaching style helped me regain my confidence. Her approach of breaking down complex concepts into
                    digestible parts and fostering an encouraging learning environment made all the difference.</p>
                <p>The course provided an in-depth understanding of power electronics, from analyzing switching circuits
                    to exploring inverter designs. A major highlight was the final project, where I designed and
                    simulated a traction drive system for an electric vehicle. This involved optimizing parameters like
                    duty ratios and modulation indices while ensuring system efficiency. This project was not just a
                    test of technical skills but also a demonstration of the practical applications of power electronics
                    in renewable energy systems and electric vehicles.</p>
                <p>Another key takeaway from the course was learning to use industry-standard tools like MATLAB and
                    Simulink for simulating power electronic systems. These tools enabled me to model and analyze
                    real-world systems, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.</p>
                <p>Beyond the technical skills, EE567 taught me the value of perseverance. From scoring poorly on my
                    first homework to gradually improving and eventually excelling, this journey was a testament to the
                    importance of hard work and determination. Dr. Yao’s support and feedback played a pivotal role in
                    helping me navigate this path and emerge stronger.</p>
                <p>EE567 was more than just an academic endeavor—it was a personal journey of growth and self-discovery.
                    The skills and lessons I gained from this course have not only prepared me for challenges in the
                    field of power electronics but also reinforced my belief in the power of resilience. I am deeply
                    grateful for the opportunity to have taken this course and for the invaluable guidance of Dr. Yao.
