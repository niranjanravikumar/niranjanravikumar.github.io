                <blockquote>
                    <p>“Artificial Intelligence is the new electricity.” – Andrew Ng</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This course, taught by Dr. Shaofeng Zou, marked a significant milestone in my academic journey. Big
                    Data Analytics bridged the gap between my practical skills and the theoretical foundations required
                    to tackle data-driven challenges. Through this course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of
                    machine learning, data analytics, and their applications at scale.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights of the course was its focus on distributed computing and big data frameworks.
                    We explored advanced techniques in data mining, clustering, and predictive modeling. These lessons
                    were complemented by practical assignments, where we implemented these techniques using real-world
                    datasets, ensuring that we not only understood the theory but also how to apply it effectively.</p>
                <p>The course culminated in a final project where my team and I designed and trained a reinforcement
                    learning model for the AWS Deep Racer platform. This project involved applying what we had learned
                    about big data and machine learning to optimize the performance of an autonomous vehicle. The
                    competition was intense, but our efforts paid off when our team secured 2nd place in the time
                    trials. This project was a testament to the power of collaboration, creativity, and applying
                    theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>In addition to technical skills, this course also honed my ability to communicate complex ideas
                    effectively. We regularly presented our work to the class, which challenged me to break down
                    technical jargon and make my findings accessible to a broader audience. These presentations
                    strengthened my confidence in public speaking and technical communication—skills that I know will
                    serve me well in my professional career.</p>
                <p>Overall, EE559 was not just a course—it was a transformative experience. It expanded my horizons,
                    strengthened my skill set, and instilled in me a deeper appreciation for the role of data in shaping
                    the future. The knowledge and experiences I gained from this course have become an integral part of
                    my academic and professional journey, equipping me to tackle complex challenges in the world of Big
                    Data Analytics.</p>
