					When I was young, the thought of pursuing Electrical Engineering seemed daunting. I was uncertain if
					I had the aptitude to excel in a field that combined intricate mathematics, complex circuit designs,
					and rapidly evolving technology. My initial hesitation stemmed from self-doubt and fear of the
					unknown. But life has a way of steering us towards our true calling, and for me, that calling became
					evident as I delved deeper into the world of electronics, systems, and innovation.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I faced significant
					academic challenges, struggling to maintain strong scores. However, I discovered a passion for
					hands-on learning in the laboratories, where I thrived. Labs like the Electronics Laboratory and
					Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory allowed me to explore concepts through practical application,
					fueling my curiosity and providing a much-needed sense of clarity. My real turning point came when I
					stepped out of my comfort zone to lead a team for the ARM Design Challenge 2016. We designed a Smart
					Helmet that could alert nearby ambulances and family members in the event of an accident. Despite
					battling severe power outages caused by the Vardah cyclone, I successfully developed the prototype,
					overcoming both technical and personal hurdles. This experience was pivotal—it taught me the value
					of perseverance and demonstrated that fear and doubt could be conquered through determination and
					hard work.
				</p>
				<p>
					After completing my undergraduate degree, I recognized the gaps in my foundational knowledge and
					took proactive steps to address them. Using resources like Khan Academy, I strengthened my
					understanding of mathematics and science while simultaneously exploring emerging fields like machine
					learning and renewable energy. This self-driven effort laid the foundation for my professional
					journey, which began as a Video Data Analyst at Valeo, where I contributed to self-driving car
					projects. Later, as a Machine Learning Data Associate at Amazon, I honed my skills in data analysis,
					consistently surpassing quality metrics and mentoring new team members. These experiences reinforced
					my belief in the importance of resilience, adaptability, and continuous learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite my early struggles in academics, I chose not to let my past define my future. When I
					embarked on my Master’s journey in Electrical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, I was
					determined to approach challenges with a renewed sense of purpose and discipline. This mindset has
					been transformative—today, my GPA stands at 3.8, a testament to the progress I’ve made and the
					lessons I’ve learned along the way. Courses like Power Electronics, Industrial Control Systems, and
					Photovoltaic Technology have allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the field while working
					on impactful projects, including the design and simulation of electric vehicle traction systems and
					the development of IoT-based safety devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					If there’s one thing my journey has taught me, it’s that failure is not the end but the beginning of
					countless opportunities. Each setback has been a stepping stone toward greater growth, teaching me
					resilience, adaptability, and the importance of learning from mistakes. Failure has shown me that
					true progress lies in perseverance and the courage to try again. By embracing failure as a natural
					part of the learning process, I’ve unlocked opportunities I never imagined possible, transforming
					challenges into triumphs and doubts into achievements. I carry this philosophy with me as I continue
					to explore and contribute to the world of Electrical Engineering.
